screencast is a digital recording of computer screen output, also known as a video screen capture or a screen recording, often containing audio [narration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration). The term screencast compares with the related term screenshot; whereas [screenshot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot) generates a single picture of a computer screen, a screencast is essentially a movie of the changes over time that a user sees on a computer screen, that can be enhanced with audio narration and captions.
